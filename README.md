-->Test Scenario:

As a part of my learning,  I created test scenario report for an online shopping site (frontend). 
It is a Test Scenario report, which contains Description about test scenario and the number of test cases written for each scenario. 
Further , I will be creating Test Case report for each scenario to understand the process of manual testing more precisely.
